## Problem We Are Solving

Some companies use an old school/outdated filing system to store information about their employees. This can lead to furstration for an individual when trying to access data about employees. For example, some parts of the information may be hard to reach due to the unorganized interface of the program/system.

Tasks such as determining employee payouts, addinga  new employee to the database, and employee termination become excruciatingly difficult with an outdated system that has little organization/display.

## Our Solution
